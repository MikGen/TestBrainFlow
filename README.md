## Installation
If you have an issue with cython package, you can build cython extension from c:
1) Clone the code to your local directory.
2) Open setup.py and change the line 6 to USE_CYTHON = 0.
3) Go to the directory with setup.py and install with "pip install ."

GPU support

If your platform has CUDA-enabled GPU, install cupy package. Then you can use
GPU device for optimization.
Package passes unit tests with cupy-cuda12x==12.2.0
